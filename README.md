# Unveiling-Overfitting-Patterns-A-Deep-Dive-into-the-Sentiment140-Dataset

Welcome to this assignment! During this week you saw different ways to handle sequence-like data. You saw how some Keras' layers such as GRU, Conv and LSTM can be used to tackle problems in this space. Now you will put this knowledge into practice by creating a model architecture that does not overfit.

For this assignment you will be using a variation of the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets alongside their respective sentiment (0 for negative and 4 for positive).

You will also need to create the helper functions very similar to the ones you coded in previous assignments pre-process data and to tokenize sentences. However the objective of the assignment is to find a model architecture that will not overfit.

# The Dataset will be online fetched by the Kaggle Link
